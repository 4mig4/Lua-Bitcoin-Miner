# Lua-Bitcoin-Miner

Written some time in 2015-2016 with https://ethan.pm/

Not written in pure lua... pretend this is pseudo-code

Was written for the ROBLOX Platform to see if distributed Bitcoin Mining through a video-game that allowed scriptint capabilites was possible, as well as for fun and profit.


Turn's out it kinda is! Most of the code is snippets from other people, such as the Bit operations, SHA256 in Lua, and Knuth RNG.
